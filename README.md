# Sorting-Visualizer

## About

#### This sorting visualizer is a project that I have wanted to work on ever since I starting learning about the different sorting algorithms. Learning about them was very interesting but I did not have a proper way to picture this in my head. This was a great way to help deepen my understanding of these algorithms and see how they perform in different situations (array size).
